A) Steps to improve performance for individual cells
1) Reducing resistance on contacts where possible
2) Inverter sized to match the rest of the cell, where possible. 
3) Balanced transistors when there is more complicated logic
4) Comparisons of cell area and timing

B) Using our designs to optimize full designs
1) choosing which type of cell
2) routing in the layer with less cell area
